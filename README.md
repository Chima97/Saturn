##Source Control
The practice concerns the tracking & management of changes to code. Git is a source-code mangement system. Allows us to manage projects.
When ever a change to the code is made, an update is recorded via  anew version number. A shared repository allows multiple developers
to access & edit a projects. To save on a computers resources, if a file hasn't changed, t just references to a previous versions file.

To implement source control, a group of developers would use Github, or any other version control system.
