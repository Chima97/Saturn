## Forking 

Forking is the copying of repositories to then be accessed locally on your computer 

### Example 

If you're trying to access someones repository, go on github to the persons repository. 
Then press the green button and press "code" then copy the link on to your local gitbash. 
After that go gitbash then clone the new repository to your system by going 'git clone [link]'
then you will have the repository on your system.

## Licensing

### Licensing allows the public to use, modify and share the base repository/code.

### Their are 2 types of Licensing*:
- Permissive
No conditions for the downstream license 


- Strong copyleft
Uses the same license downstream


*This is the recommended workflow process for making changes throughout a project's lifecycle.*

### Follow these steps

1. Make a new feature branch
2. Switch to the new feature branch
3. Make changes
4. Stage changes
5. Commit changes
6. Push changes
7. If more changes are needed for your current feature branch, restart at Step 3
8. Switch back to develop branch
9. Once no more changes are required, merge those changes into develop branch
10. Delete feature branch if necessary
