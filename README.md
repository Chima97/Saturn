##**Licensing**

###Licensing allows the public to use, modify and share the base repository/code.

###*Their are 2 types of Licensing*:
- Permissive
No conditions for the downstream license 


- Strong copyleft
Uses the same license downstream


*This is the recommended workflow process for making changes throughout a project's lifecycle.*

### Follow these steps

1. Make a new feature branch
2. Switch to the new feature branch
3. Make changes
4. Stage changes
5. Commit changes
6. Push changes
7. If more changes are needed for your current feature branch, restart at Step 3
8. Switch back to develop branch
9. Once no more changes are required, merge those changes into develop branch
10. Delete feature branch if necessary
