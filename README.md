# Branching
it branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.

1. git branch <new_branch_name>
	Creates a branch from current
	
2. git checkout -b <new_branch_name>
	Creates branch and 'checks out' to the new branch, which means it'll position you onto the new branch as it is created
	
3. git checkout <branch_name>
	Will set it to another branch
	
4. git branch -d <branch_name>
	Deletes a branch
	
5. git --delete origin <branch_name>
	Deletes the branch from develop
	
Once you have made your branch you must push it for it to be shown on your repository.
$ git push

If you have created files within your branch, you will need to commit these files before you push your branch
